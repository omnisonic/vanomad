</footer><!-- /.post-info --> <p>Today I did a first test fit of my diy roof rack and 180 watt solar panel.  It worked!  What a relief after so much back and forth trying to find the right components to make it all fit together securely.</p>
<p>My aim is to try make a low profile, strong, easily modifiable and repairable, and economical solution for mounting solar panels on the top of my Transit Connect van.  I want fit as much solar as possible.  I did measurements and I think I can fit just over 300 watts.  As I said, today was just a trial fit of the basic rack framing so I only put one panel on.  </p>
<p>It turned out low profile and stealthy.  A look I was hoping.  I used the thin channel strut which is plenty rigid and strong enough for holding the panels.  Mounted on top is a 175 watt panel and from this angle you can barely see it which is great.  <a href="https://amzn.to/2KnbcYN">Buy 175 Watt Solar Panel on Amazon </a>

<p>I mounted door hinges to  strut channel and to the solar panels.  These are door hinges with a removable pin so that the panels could be easily separated from the strut. Mounted on hinges, I will be able to angle the panels towards the sun to increase their efficiency.  <a href="https://amzn.to/2KlQrMY">Buy hinges on Amazon</a></p>

<p>These channel nuts with the blue plastic rings worked great for fastening the hinges to the strut. <a href="https://amzn.to/38occ6T">Buy channel strut nuts on Amazon </a></p>

<p>Here the panel has been successfully mounted to the channel strut on hinges and can easily be position at any angle.  Of course I will need to construct some sturdy braces to hold the other end of the panel up--in the picture i am just holding it up with my hand.</p>

<p>Here I am testing out the spacers between the channel strut and the roof of the van.  The top of the Transit connect is slightly curved so spacers are necessary.  I am using the four existing mounting point on the roof.  The spacers have a hole in the middle that the bold will go through.  I needed something heavy duty and I found  automotive suspension grommets do the job. <a href="https://amzn.to/3p5WROY">suspension grommets on Amazon</a></p>

<p>Here you can see the length of the channel strut mount across the van roof.</p>

<p>This view shows the bolt and the washer in channel strut to hold it down.</p>

<p>Now I have the crossbar mounted but there is a little problem.  the bolt is tight up against the edge of hole in the channel strut...maybe a little too tight.  this happened because of the distance between the mounting holes in the roof.  The don't line up so goo with the holes in the strut.   I will probably drill out or file out some metal so that there is not so much pressure on the sides of the bolts.</p>

<p>This is the other end, you can see the same issue with the bolt up against the edge of the hole.  It is a minor issue, but for now I want to put the panel up and see how it looks.</p>

<p>As soon as I mounted the panel.  I took it for a test drive to the marina.  The rack works great.  </p>

<p>The driver side view.  On this side I used zip ties to secure the panel to the rack, just temporarily. I think I will also put hinges on this side as well.  Then I can angle have the option of angling the panels from either side.  I also like that I can easily remove the panel from the rack by removing the hinge pins.</p>
