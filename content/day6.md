I stayed at a rest stop overlooking mono lake the previous night. I was the only on there.

A little morning walk up the hill to look at my surroundings.

I found a forest road nearby leading to this big open pull-out that would make a great spot to camp.  I knew from the wether report that winds and snow storm possible today so I didn't want to be on the road.  I decided to camp here.

I stayed in my van and practiced guitar for most of the day.  A break in the storm and I stepped out to amazing views.

The snow was light and fluffy.

The snow wasnt to thick, so I new I could get my van out if I went slow.  but I was going to spend the night here at such a great spot.

I decided to go for a hike and explore this forest service road a bit further.

The views after the snow were amazing with Lake Mono in the distance.

I don't know what this is... maybe some old mining or water treatment equipment? It was cool though.

After a fresh snow  and late in the afternoon in the sierras make for great photos.

I didn't camp here, as I've decided its too early in the season.  But I hope to come back someday!

Last night in the cold.  Tomorrow I will head further south on and down in eleveation on hwy 395.  I don't mind the cold so much because I have a heater, but rrunning it all day uses up the propane in my little tank.
