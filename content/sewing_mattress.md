I used my camping mattresses that I have used over the years to contruct the van bed mattress.  They ware two feet wide which is how wide the van bed/bench is without the pullout extension.

I stack four different camping foam mattreses.

I got a mini sewing machine a while ago in anticipation that I would be making custom cushion covers and other textiles for the van.  

I tested it out on some material but I had a horrible time with it.

So finally, after wishin I had one for many years.  I got my own heavy duty sewing machine.  I know I will have to just sell it back soon but at least I can use it to make quality cover and curtains for the van. 

I used some curtains I had purchased for my apartment to make the bed/bench cushion covers.  I measerd the cirumfrancs of the four foam sleeping pads figure out how to cut the material to a good fit.  For the seem I added 2 inches in addtion to the toral.

I used a sharpie and a straight edge to mark where I would make the cuts.

Then I foled the materialin half, marked a board aling the esge, one inch in with sharpie and straight edge.

The I folded the material in half, marked a boarder along ege --one inch in, using a sharpie and straight edge.

I had already set up the Sewing machine.   I learned to sew from my outdoor club teacher in college.  But I definatly need a refresher from the instructions that came with the van.

I sewed two straight lines along the edge and the end of the cover.

I turned it inside out to hide the seames, and insterted the pads.  Glad I got it right on the first try.
