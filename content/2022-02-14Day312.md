Many different types of rocks.  Some of them I could not resist picking up and putting in my pocket. I have a pocket full of rocks now.  I'm sure I'll find a use for them.

I spent two weeks here.  There were a few days of wind  storms.  Bot most of the time was very nice weather.  A great place to spend the winter.
