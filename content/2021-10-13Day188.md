I took several similar shots of my van with the beautiful snowy, fall landscape.  Here I have combined them into a gif.

This shot up sign used to read: 
" A major encounter between the U.S. Army and a large group of Utes and Jicarilla Apaches occurred here in July 1848. Old Bill Williams, the famous scout and guide, was badly wounded while fighting the Utes, who had once adopted him as a tribesman."

Even though i am migrating south to escape the cold, I am glad I got to pass through a goodbye snow storm in Colorado.

I had to get my good camera for these shots.  I haven't used it in a long time.  Luckily I still had some charge on the battery.

A new Rye whisky I've been enjoying.  The bottle looks like from the old wild west days.  you can see little air bubbles in the glass.  A toast to making  down the mountain through the wintery roads.

Alway looking for tasty, quick to prepare foods on the road.  This rice pouch is precooked and take just a minute or two to heat up.  Taste great with a dap of butter on top.

I liked how my van matches the color of snow and winter clouds.
