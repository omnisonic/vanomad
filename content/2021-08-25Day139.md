I have been camping around the Santa Fe National for a couple weeks.  I am about to leave Santa Fe Area so I decided to go to the top of mountain to see.

Great trails up here.  Trail heads and parking up at the end of HWY 475 where Ski Santa Fe is.   I just went for a day hike.

I took the Winsor Trail.  The little creek running near by the trail was crystal clear and enchanting.

One of my favorite things about the Santa Fe National Forest is how pristine they are-- the tall aspen and pine.

The Aspen Basin Campgound up here is pretty informal and undeveloped.

A lot of it is just dirt parking lot, which suite me just fine as long as trails are nearby.  I stayed for a couple nights.

Elevation up here  is about 10'000 feet.  Saying goodbye and driving down the mountains.
