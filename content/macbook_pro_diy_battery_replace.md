Never had  the battery replaced on my macbook pro from late 2013.  That is about a 7 year old battery and it was not doing great, only holding about 1 hour of charge.  I found a  battery replacement kit on amazon for very good price and decided to attempt a replacement.  I have done battery replacements on iphone but this is my first macbook replacent.

The battery was well packed.  two different screw drivers were included for removing the tiny screws.

I first completely shutdown the macbook and flip it over.  I remove the screws from the bottom panel.

The inside of the laptop.  The batteries are glued on with strong glue.  I used string to go under the batteries to saw through the glue.  I slowly pulled each end of the string back and fourth, kind of like flossing.

Eventually I got through all the glue and the old batteries came out.  I removed some of the remaining residue with a plastic scraper.

Finally installed the new battery and replaced the screws for the wiring harness.   the new batter fit perfectly.

The computer successfully powers on.  I know have close to 7 hours of battery life if just doing text or light browsing.  Well worth the price and the labor.  It even feels as if the computer is operating a bit faster!
