Found An amazing spot west of Inedependence, Ca.

The view of the sierra moutains was breathtaking.

No shade at this spot and I new I would be staying here for at least a couple days so I set up my awning.

My camp was not to far from the main road so I went for a bike ride.  I headed towards the mountains.

I found a developed campground that was closed.  There was a little creek there and I stopped to enjoy it a bit and filter some water.

Took this photo in case I decide to come camp here.  It was officially closed-- no camp host, no amenities and no fee collections, but it seemed the grounds were open for dry camping at least.
