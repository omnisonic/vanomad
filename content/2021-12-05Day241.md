There is a lot of history here.  I just explored a little bit.  This sign reads:
>THE FIRST. Grease rack installed to service United State Army automotive equipment engaged in field operations. The United States Army used motorized transport for the first time in the 1916 punitive expedition staged from this point against Mexican General Francisco (Pancho) Villa and his troops.  It dispatched civilian drivers here to teach the soldiers how to operate and service the trucks. On occasion and far distant from this base of operations the trucks received fuel transported by pack animals.

This one reads:
>Site fo the last hostile action by foreign troops in the Continental United States. Led by General Francisco (Pancho ) Villa, insurgent Mexican forces on the night of March 9, 1916 raided camp Furlong, a United States army cantonment, and the nearby town of Columbus. Several people were killed, many others were wounded and numerous buildings and tents were burned. The underlying motive of the raid is still a dispute among survivors and historians.  Six days later United States punitive forces under General John J. (Black Jack) Pershing entered Mexico and pursued Pancho Villa and his band without success. 
In recognition of the subsequent long continued friendly relation of the two countries the New Mexico State Legislature in 1959 designed this site as a State Park.

There is a little hill by the campground and trails that wind through the cactus garden and lead to the top.

The sign reads:

> This hill, which is named after Captain Cootes of the 13th Cavalry, was an important lookout for soldiers based at Camp Furlong during the Mexican Revolution border unrest.  From this vantage point sometimes referred to ass "Villa Hill," Mexico can be seen a few miles to the south.  It is thought that the Villista raiders entered Columbus from the southwest, moving around this hill, on March 9, 1916.

Cacti grow around here like grass.

I moved to a more rustic spot. No electricity, but I save $4 a day.  I am getting ready to leave the comfort of New Mexico State Parks as I move west for the winter.  I will need to learn to get by with just solar power.
