I headed into town to get some cell signal and do some work on the internet.  I found little park in Bishop to be very pleasant.

I took a jog around the park and did some bird watching.

I took a pic of this plaque to remember to look this guy up.

Later in the day I was on the hunt for where I would stay the night.  This place was already full.

This place was full too. And maybe had the plague!?

Still on the search for a place to sleep tonight.  I took a    little break to enjoy the scenery.

Getting dark and another campground that seemed crowded.  I ended up staying at a hwy rest area for the night.  It was between Bishop, where I just came from, and Independence, Ca.  I was tired after 3 hours of driving and searching down bumpy dirt roads so I didn't get a photo of the rest stop.
