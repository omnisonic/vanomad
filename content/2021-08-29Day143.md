Sometimes its hard choosing your a campsite.   Especially in a huge campground like Lake Hereon.  You want to get in the goldilocks zone.

Driving around would be ridiculous.  My strategy is to ride my bicycle!

This time of year there are few campers here.  So I had a bunch of choices.

Lake Heron is one of my favorite campgrounds.

There is a very long trail running through the campground.

Its a very gravely trail so a mountain bike would be better then my hybrid bike.

But I enjoyed running along the trail as well as the shoreline.

Another campground with another lake is just several miles away.  You can move back and fourth every two weeks to get around the 14 day stay limit.
