I am about to saw the butcher block with my battery powered circular saw.  I have been worried that the battery powered saw may not cut the thick butcher block.

So far it is cutting but I have to go slow and steady.  I also had to take a break and fully charge the saw battery.

Cut complete!  A relief that my little saw that I have had for years could muster the strengh to cut through such a slab.

Time to get out the tung oil and apply a coat to the cut.  I might as well sand the whole thing down and apply another coat all around for an even nicer finish.  Last summer I built a desk/workstation with this butcher block table top.  I really came to appreciate tung oil.  It is all natural and penetrates the wood and protects it quit well.  It does take a long time to dry.

All done with the coat of tung oil.  I can alway add another coat in the futre if I want.  This already looks much better then the plywood I had on top.
