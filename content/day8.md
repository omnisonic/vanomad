I left the BLM campsite after one night because I could not get a good cell signal there.  It seems I am on the contant search for the goldilocks zone of campsites. The right temperature, cell signal, privacy, and proximity to resuply. However, I got zero cell signal at this new spot today.  It was a creekside spot that really challenged my offroad skills and tested the ability of my little two wheel drive van.  I am glad I put some new truck tires on it before I left.  I also have some tread mats that came in handy going down the rough terrain to this little creekside spot.

It was worth the effort and attempt to go down the rough terrain and be able to camp so close to the creek.

I took the opportunity to build a little campfire.  I dug a hole and gathered the rocks to make a fire ring.  Safety is very important so I aways have a shovel and water nearby to complelty put out the fire.

I brought my music stand out so I can practice guitar after dinner.  The music stand also makes for a great camping dinner table.
