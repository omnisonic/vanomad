I made it to the sierras with my little van fully loaded.  The spot I was orinally thinking to camp had road closures.  Still a lot of snow on the ground.  Luckily I found a large turn out close by.  Just on the side of hwy 88.  The views were already very nice.  this would be my first time boondocking in the high sierras.
