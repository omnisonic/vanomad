A charge controller conects your solar panels to your battery.  It helps regulate the charging of you battery from the solar panels.  I have had this charge controller for a couple of years and never had any issues.  It is still going strong.  I have used it to charge both Sealed AGM Battery and Lipo batteries.  Of course you  would need to change the setting to match the corresesponding charge profile.  But the built in presets seemed to work fine for both.
